# PressMint: Comparable Historical Newspaper Corpora

The [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/parlamint) PressMint project
plans to compile corpora of historical newspapers for a number of countries and languages.

PressMint corpora are to be interoperable, i.e. encoded to a common PressMint schema,
a customisation of the [TEI Guidelines](https://tei-c.org/guidelines/p5/),
but with various down-stream formats (TSV, CoNLL-U, JSON etc.) also available.
The same scripts should process the common data in any PressMint corpus,
despite the different kind of information included in the corpora, and, of course, language.

The PressMint Git workflow, scripts and documentation will be cased on those of the
[ParlaMint](https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/) project,
which builds richly annotated corpora of parliamentary proceedings
for a large number of countries and autonomous regions

This Git repository is, as yet, a stub with few of the content planned.
Note that there are several branches for different parts of the development.

* The *[Samples](Samples/) directory* contains directories by contributing (CLARIN) country.
  It will eventually include samples for all variants and formats of the ParlaMint corpora.
